## Getting Started
NOTE: Make sure you have Node.js and npm or yarn installed in your PC.
- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/rukundoeric/fitness-tracker-frontend.git`
- Navigate into project directory: `cd fitness-tracker-frontend`
- Create file called `.env.development`
- Clone this repo in another directory`https://github.com/rukundoeric/fitness-tracker-backend.git`
- Navigate to into project directory and then run `bundle install`
- After that, then run `rails c` and then in rails console run `Rails.application.secrets.secret_key_base`. Copy the text you get and go back to front-end project.
- open `.env.development` and initialize thise valiables
  ```
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000
    REACT_APP_TOKEN_SECRET=VALUE YOU COPYED FROM THE PREVIOUS STEP
  ```
- Install all packages: `yarn install or npm install`
- Start the app: `yarn start or npm start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.
